# Mapvoyage

I'm building an open source app for viewing the Wikivoyage travel guide on a map. 

If you're interested in contributing (code, design, ideas, testing or otherwise), want to be informed about progress on this app or are interested in joining this project you can contact me at hi@mapvoyage.app :) 

## Tech Stack
Is not yet set in stone, but mainly:
* React Native (targeting iOS, Android and later web)
* tRPC
* Maptiler for OSM Maps and Geocoding
* MariaDB (for querying Wikivoyage data)
