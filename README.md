# Mapvoyage

I'm building an open source app for viewing the Wikivoyage travel guide on a map. 

If you're interested in contributing (code, design, ideas, testing or otherwise), are interested in joining this project or want to chat you can contact me at hi@mapvoyage.app :) 

## Tech Stack
Is not yet set in stone, but mainly:
* React Native (targeting iOS, Android and later web)
* tRPC
* Maptiler for OSM Maps and Geocoding
* MariaDB (for querying Wikivoyage data)
