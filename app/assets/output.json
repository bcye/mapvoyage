This catastrophe is known in the Netherlands as the Vuurwerkramp, Dutch for *fireworks disaster*. Since this event, the city has undergone a major reconstruction process. After the fall of the textile industry, Enschede strives to become a center of business, innovation and technology through the Business and Science park next to the University of Twente.\n\nAs a city famous for being \"destroyed and reconstructed\" many times, Enschede does not offer much in terms of historical attractions. However, the city has nice displays of contemporary Dutch architecture, particularly in the Roombeek neighborhood and at University of Twente, and its nightlife, cultural vibrancy and shopping options are quite developed for a city of its size."

            "markdown": "As Enschede has a university and is the second largest town in the eastern Netherlands it has a fair number of bars and cafes. The Oude Markt is the location of many bars and bistros which have large terraces, making it the perfect location for a drink on a warm summer night. The oldest pub in Enschede is Het Bolwerk, in the Bolwerkstraat, where one can drink a wide variety of beers and spirits, with the shocking exception of the Enschede-brewed Grolsch.\n\nWhile the hipper crowds turn to places like **Aspen Valley** and **Central Park**, the alternative scene spends their Saturday night in **Atak**, where one can see a wide variety of customers from hippies to gothics to hard-core-metal-lovers. The student associations also have their own pub in de Pakkerij, like the largest student association of Enschede, [AEGEE-Enschede](http://www.aegee-enschede.nl) which is often also open to visits from AEGEE students visiting from other European student cities."
